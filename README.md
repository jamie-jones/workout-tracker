## DESCRIPTION

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

This app allows the user to track their workout routine. If you need to edit a workout you already made, or delete one you prerecorded but ended up not doing? No problem! You can do that here no problem!
